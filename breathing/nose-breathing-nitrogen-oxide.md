## Nose Breathing

I've long known some of the benefits of nose breathing over mouth breathing. Breathing through the nose serves to filter airborne particles from the air, to warm the air before it reaches your lungs, and to control the rate at which the air reaches your lungs. What I learned today was about nose breathing, our sinuses, and nitrogen oxide.

In 1998 three American scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine for their discovery of nitrogen oxide's ability to expand blood vessels, known as vasodilation. And later in 2002 a research group in Sweden found that nitrogen oxide is formed and released in human sinuses.

When you breath through your nose, the nasal air is mixed with nitrogen oxide-containing sinus air. The nitrogen oxide is then inhaled into the lungs, causing the blood vessels to expand and allowing a greater volume of blood to pass, whereby more oxygen can be taken up. As a result, blood is 10-15% more oxygenated when you breath through your nose than when you breath through your mouth.
