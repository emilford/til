## HTML Mark Text element

The Mark Text element, per the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/mark) is used to mark or highlight text due to its relevance or importance. I first saw it used to highlight an error message during a failed sign-in attempt.

Other noted uses include:

* to indicate text of special interest or that needs special scrutinity, but that was not originally indicated as such

* to indicate text of specific relevance to the current user's activity (e.g., a failed sign-in attempt)
